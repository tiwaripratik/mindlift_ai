🧠 MindLift AI
CBT-Based Depression Counsellor using LLMs and Agentic AI

MindLift AI is an AI-powered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)–based depression counsellor designed to provide empathetic, personalized, and stigma-free mental health support.
The system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), PHQ-8 depression assessment, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a dedicated empathy validation model to simulate structured CBT sessions in a safe and accessible manner.
